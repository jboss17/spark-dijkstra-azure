# CSC 4311 Programming Assignment

This repository contains scripts for **Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm with Apache Spark on Azure VMs**.

It includes installation, configuration, starting, and stopping of Spark components (Master, Workers, and History Server) in a standalone cluster setup.  
The Dijkstra's algorithm runs on a distributed graph stored in a text file, and computes shortest paths efficiently using Apache Spark and GraphX.

All scripts are located inside the `scripts/` folder.

May need to run `chmod +x scripts/*.sh` to make scripts executable.

Ensure inbound port rules have been set in your VM for port 8080 (Spark Master UI) and 18080 (Spark History Server UI).

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Connect to VM

```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-vm-private-key.pem <username>@<public-IP-of-vm>
```

### 2. Clone Repo

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jboss17/spark-dijkstra-azure.git
    cd spark-dijkstra-azure/scripts
```
### 3. Setup Environment

```bash
    ./setup_env.sh
    ./configure_spark.sh [azureuser]
```

### 4. Start Cluster

```bash
    ./start-master.sh
    ./start-worker.sh
    ./start-history-server.sh
```

### 6. Submit Spark Job

```bash
    ./submit [starting_node]
```

### 7. Stop Cluster

```bash
    ./stop-all.sh
```
